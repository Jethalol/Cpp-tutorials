Shakespeare poem - 
    
" There are 152 short sonnets attributed to Shakespeare. 
    Among them, the most famous ones are Sonnet 29, Sonnet 71, 
    and Sonnet 55. As a collection, narrative sequence of his 
    Sonnets speaks to Shakespeare's deep insecurity and jealousy 
    as a lover, his grief at separation, and his delight in sharing
    beautiful experiences with his romantic counterparts. However, 
    few scholars believe that the sequence of the sonnets accurately 
    depicts the order in which they were written. Because Shakespeare 
    seemed to write primarily for his own private audience, dating these 
    short jewels of literature has been next to impossible. "
