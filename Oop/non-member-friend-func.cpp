Friend function can be a Normal non-member global function or Method of other class (but not the class itself

encapsulation by giving access to non member function. these non member methods gets acces to class attribute and
can even make changes to it. */

/*
Following are some important points about friend functions and classes: 
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as 
friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes 
in object-oriented programming.

2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.

3) Friendship is not inherited. if A is friend of B and B is friend of C then A is NOT friend of C.
