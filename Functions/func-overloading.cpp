/* How  Function Overloading works?
Exact match:- (Function name and Parameter)

If a not exact match is found:â€“

/    ->Char, Unsigned char, and short are promoted to an int.
/    ->Float is promoted to double

If no match found:
/     ->C++ tries to find a match through the standard conversion.
